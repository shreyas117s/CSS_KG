Color System (Color Theory)

• RGB Model: Creates colors by mixing Red (R), 
Green (G), and Blue (B) light sources.
• Additive Model: More light means increased 
brightness.
• Primary Colors: R, G, and B are the 
foundational colors.
• White & Black: All combined yield white; 
absence equals black.
• Color Depth: Allows for millions of color 
variations.




Three Channels: Consists of Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B)
channels to create a variety of colors.
• Syntax: Utilized as rgb(r, g, b) where r, g, and b are values 
between 0 and 255.
